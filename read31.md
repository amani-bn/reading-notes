#  <b>Responsive Web Design</b> 

## <b>RWD</b> is practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size.

### Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change .
###  adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation .

#  Responsive web design is broken down into three main components:

|Component:|Defintion|
| ------- |----------------------------------------------------------|
|flexible layouts|the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width|
|Media queries| provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example|
|Flexible Media|As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit.Images,videos,and other media types need to be scalable|

## There are a couple different ways to use media queries:
- using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet.
- by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document.
