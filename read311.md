# Q: What is EJS?
<b>EJS</b> is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

# <b>EJS</b> is a template system. You define <b>HTML</b> pages in the EJS syntax and you specify where various data will go in the page. Then, your app combines data with the template and "renders" a complete HTML page where EJS takes your data and inserts it into the web page according to how you've defined the template.

## EJS also supports shared templates that can be inserted into other templates (e.g. for a common header/footer in your web pages) so you can specify that layout once and then use it in all your other templates rather than repeating that HTML over and over in all your pages. 

# EJS is a tool for generating web pages that can include dynamic data and can share templated pieces with other web pages (such as common headers/footers). It is not a front-end framework. While EJS can be used by client-side Javascript to generate HTML on the client-side, it is more typically used by your back-end to generate web pages in response to some URL request.

## <b>EJS</b> is not a client-side framework like Angular or React and does not dictate what client-side framework you do or don't use .
