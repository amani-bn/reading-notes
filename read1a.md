- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue Briefly a text editor that has a great selection of extension  Definitely  you have the ability to add more functionality).
  
Every computer will come with its own text editor but donâ€™t have many features if you need more features that you may be interested in download and install another text editor on your comuter such as (Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,Brackets, and Sublime Text).
