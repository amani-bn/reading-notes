|opetor|what doing |
|------ |-------------------------------------------------------------------------                     |
|==|    |  compares two values(numbers,strings,boolean) to see if they are the same                    |
|!=|    | compares two values (numbers,strings,boolean) to see if they are not the same                |
|===|   |  compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same                 |
|!==|   | compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same              |
|> |    | this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right       |
|< |    |this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right           |
|>=|    |this operator checks if the number onthe left is greater than or equal the number onthe right |
|<=|    |this operator checks if the nymber on the left is less than or equal the number on the right  |


## logical opertor : allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator .

| opertor | | what doing |
| ****** | |****** |
| && | | this opertor tests more than one condtion |
||| | | this opertor tests at least one condtion. |
| ! | |  this opertor takes a single boolean value and invert it |

loops check a condtion, if it return true acode will run until the condtion return false.
 
 ## there are three types of loops :
- FOR : use when you need to run code a specific number of times .
- WHILE : use when you do not know how many times the code should run.
- DO WHILE : it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once even if  the condition evaluates to false.

## for loop: uses a counter as a condition,so you must intialize the counter then do the condition then update the value of a counter.

## while :
- The first statement uses the+= operator, which is used to add new content to the msg variable. 
- The second statement increments the counter variable by one.
- When the loop has finished, the interpreter goes to the next line of code, which writes the msg variable to the page.
