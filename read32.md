# jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in your pages. 

## Q: why we iclude JQuery ?
### A: it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser JavaScript.

# How JQuery work:
- Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree.
- Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection.

## jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers.

## jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform.
