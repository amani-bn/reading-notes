## How do computer work :

### theres 4 ports of a computer :
- inputs which can be from (keyboard,microphone,camera,..)
- output from computer maybe input for else 
- central processing unit (CPU): processor takes informations from memory and change it using algorithim and send back to store im memory  
- memory whers the data stored
  
inside computers there is wires and circuits that carry all the informations in a computer
every wire represent a bit

### bit : the smallest piece of informations a computer can store , with more bits you can represent more complex information .

computer work on binary system which have 2 digit zero and one (0,1),computer work on binary system which have 2 digit zero and one (0,1)
any number or other things like (images,text,sounds,videos,..) can be represent with this two digit .
so that any character or pixels represent with number.

### there is two types of circuit :
- simple circuit : take an electric signals and flips it .
- complicated circuit : take multiple signals and combine them to give different results such as adder circuit .
electricty moves at just a bout the speed of lights and this is why smallest computer faster
to display each letter a computer runs thoushands of instructions starting from fingers press keyboard .

#### hardware conatin (circuits,chips,speakers,plugs,stuff).
#### CPU : master chip that control all the other ports of the computer it has two type of circuit math and logic one and the other send and recieve information to and from different types of computer, the cpu recieve simple commands that tell it which circuit to use .

#### operating system : the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer .
