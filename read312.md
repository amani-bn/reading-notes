![](read12.png)

## Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

### In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters
